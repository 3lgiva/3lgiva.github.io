<h3>Pros and con of romeo (fico, romi, ro-ro, lulu, our little bitchy boy) </h3>


|pro|con|
|---|---|
|he has money| he's a little shit|
|he's from "House of Lucci", which is a famous family from Italy known for their high end luxury brand| will throw insults at you like it's money|
|Will worry about your skin care routine like it's the end of the world| abbreviate *a lot* of his insults to a point when you ask what they mean, **he will insult u more**. (ex: TGA = "tiresome","good-for-nothing","asshole" (don't ask me how i remember that))|
|weapon of choice is a sniper rifle| he can shot properly.|

<body>
    <h3>yes lexeigh.... <s>he's a major red flag</s> he's an atomic bomb.... BUT HEAR ME OUT</h3>

        <li class="highlightedlistitem">
            He's pretty.
        </li>
        <li class="highlightedlistitem">
            Besides that, he will kill for you <- and that's what we like
            </li>
        <li class="highlightedlistitem">
            on top of that, romi may used you to gain the upper hand <b>BUT</b> he'll make sure to keep you safe <3
            </li>
        <li class="highlightedlistitem">
            may seem like a bitch at first meeting- but he warms up overtime (i promise i'm not being bias)
        </li>
        <li class="highlightedlistitem">
            will come after those who bully you <b>AND</b> force them to go missing.
        </li>
            <h3>I rest my case</h3>
                <p></p>
