 <h3>Pros and con of romeo (romi,ro-ro, lulu, our little bitchy boy)</h3>


|pro|con|
|---|---|
|he has money| he's a little shit|
|he's from "House of Lucci", which is a famous family from Italy known for their high end luxury brand| will throw insults at you like it's money|
|Will worry about your skin care routine like it's the end of the world| abbreviate *a lot* of his insults to a point when you ask what they mean, **he will insult u more**. (ex: TGA = "tiresome","good-for-nothing","asshole" (don't ask me how i remember that))|
|weapon of choice is a sniper rifle| he can shot properly.
